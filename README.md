To make myself accountable and learn the Python language. I am committing to following an udemy course online. Do at least 1 exercise daily and to post it here on GitHub.

DAY 1 Complete.
I am taking the automate simple tasks with python tutorial and I completed 5 out of 52 videos and i wrote a simple basic program.

Day 2 complete: Though, this happened 4 days after day 1.
